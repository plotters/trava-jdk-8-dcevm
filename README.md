Trava dcevm-8 
==============
Dcevm-8 built on Travis, driven by AdoptOpenJDK scripts.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/plotters/trava-jdk-8-dcevm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/plotters/trava-jdk-8-dcevm)

## Motivation:

Dcevm missed automated builds for a long time! Thanks to iron from Travis and scripts from AdoptOpenJDK we 
have all what we need now. 

## Build your binaries!
Even better, it is not necessary to use supplied binaries, you can build the binaries youself. It can be done in several
clicks:

* Fork this repository
* Create user account on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
* Change the **deploy** part in `.travis.yml` to upload the result to your repository
* Create tagged commit and wait for your binaries!
